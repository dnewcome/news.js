# About

News.js aims to be a functional replacement for the news.arc server that powers Hacker News.

# Status

The current state of the code is very rough. I'm releasing the code as-is with the hopes of refining it further as 
my time permits, but it is not a current priority for me. The code was based on a small private tool that I 
created to track and prioritize my projects. I added the ability to create multiple user accounts and copied
the news.ycombinator layout (tables and all).

# Limitations

Scoring of articles does not take time into account. Articles are ranked strictly on votes. Threading of 
comments is barely done, and the page flow when adding new comments is pretty broken.

# Further Work

I'm hoping that there will be some interest in having a Reddit/HN-style news app for node.js 
is interesting to others so I'm releasing what I have so far. If there is more interest and
if I have the time I'll work on it more and I'd welcome suggestions and contributions.
