# About

News.js aims to be a functional replacement for the news.arc server that powers Hacker News.

# Status

I'm using News.js on audiohackers.org to support my meetup group. The code evolves when I need
something new, but is infrequently updated.

# Limitations

Scoring of articles does not take time into account. Articles are ranked strictly on votes.
there is no paging or separation of new articles vs ranked articles.

# Further Work

I'm hoping that there will be some interest in having a Reddit/HN-style news app for node.js.
I welcome suggestions and contributions.
